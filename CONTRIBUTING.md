## Indentation

* Indent Makefiles with 8-character **tabs**, not spaces. Make only supports tabs when indenting.
* Indent HTML with 4 spaces.
* Indent everything else with 2 spaces.

## Language

* Don't use excess slang.
* Keep unecessary abberivations like "SVN" and "GH" to a minimum, because their real meaning is
  very short already and there is no need for abberivating it. Exceptions are if you are
  referring to a tool with those names (e.g. the GitHub CLI's binary is called `gh`).

## Python

Even though Oh My Bash projects normally do not have code written in Python, sometimes it may be
the only option.

In this case:
* Always conform to PEP-8.
* Indent with 4 spaces. Don't use tabs.
* Don't use python if Bash can do it. Exceptions include using `webbrowser` to open a web page.
